      "# Lab 0: Introduction to Pandas and IPython\n",
      "\n",
      "This lab guide assumes two things:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. a (very) basic familiarity with Python and the command line, but no more than that.\n",
      "2. that you have installed the [Anaconda distribution](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/ \"Anaconda Python\")\n",
      "  of Python for your computer. The dependencies for Python's scientific computing stack are complicated and this is the easiest option to get up-and-running.\n",
      " \n",
      "## Installing Pandas and IPython in a virtual environment\n",
      "\n",
      "To make sure that this lab guide works on your computer, and to allow you to keep modules in one Python project separate from those in another, we will create a 'virtual environment' using Anaconda. This creates a safe laboratory space in which you can install whatever packages you find useful for statistical analysis, without worrying that these will break something elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open a command prompt or terminal and create a virtual environment called `openintrolabs` by using this command:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "conda create -n openintrolabs python=3.4\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This has created a fresh Python 3 installation for us - and because it is enclosed in a virtual environment, this won't affect any existing Python 2 projects you may have. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now enter this environment by using the following command if you are using Windows:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "activate openintrolabs\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, if you are using a Linux distribution:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "source activate openintrolabs\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's install a few packages into our base Python environment:\n",
      "- Pandas, a data analysis toolkit.\n",
      "- Matplotlib, for plotting.\n",
      "- Statsmodels, for statistical function. \n",
      "- IPython, for creating interactive notebooks\n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure you are in your openintrolabs virtual environment and enter these commands:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "conda install pandas\n",
      "conda install ipython-notebook\n",
      "conda install matplotlib\n",
      "conda install statsmodels\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We should now have a working environment for data analysis. Let's get started!\n",
      "\n",
      "## Getting started with Pandas and IPython\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll conduct our data analysis in IPython 'notebooks'. As the name suggests, you can *write* in IPython notebooks, but you can also use them to execute Python code and display visualizations or other graphics. They are a powerful tool for data exploration and statistical analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Start the notebook server by, first, navigating to a convenient working folder on the command line and then executing the following command in your virtual environment. (After doing so, you will need to keep the terminal running as you work.)\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "ipython notebook\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few seconds, your browser should open a new tab like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=\"images/ipython_server.png\"/>\n",
      "\n",
      "Create a notebook by clicking 'new' in the top right-hand corner and then selecting 'Python 3' under 'Notebooks'. This will open a new tab which contains a notebook, ready for us to work in.\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=\"images/ipython_0.png\"/>\n",
      "\n",
      "At the top of the screen 'Untitled' is the name of our notebook. We can change this by clicking on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The white rectange labelled `In [ ]:` is a cell. A cell is where we enter code or text.\n",
      "\n",
      "More cells can be added with the + button on the toolbar and cells can be rearranged with the up and down arrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cell input type (code or Markdown text) can be changed using the dropdown menu that is set to 'Code' by default.\n",
      "\n",
      "Click into the first cell, change the type to Markdown and enter the following text:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "# Getting started with Pandas and IPython\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Press shift and enter to run this cell. The `#` is Markdown code for a large heading and so IPython renders this text as a nice big title for our notebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's run some Python code and get started with data analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Input these lines into the first cell after your heading and run the cell:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",
      "%matplotlib inline\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "These lines import pandas, the data analysis library and, by convention, rename it to pd. Now when we call pandas functions, we will call pd. It saves us four whole keystrokes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second line tells IPython to draw graphs in the notebook itself rather than creating separate windows each time.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Reading data into Pandas\n",
      "\n",
      "We can now start working with data. In a new cell enter and execute the following code:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "present_url = 'https://github.com/ScatteredInk/OpenIntro-Python-Labs/raw/master/Lab0/present.csv'\n",
      "\n",
      "present = pd.read_csv(present_url)\n",
      "\n",
      "present.head()\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This code may take a few seconds to execute as it is instructing Pandas to open a CSV file located on the internet and store this in the variable `present`. When the file has downloaded, the `head()` function instructs Pandas to display the first few rows of the data.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
