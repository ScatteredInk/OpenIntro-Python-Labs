# OpenIntro Statistics Python Labs

[OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/) is an excellent, and freely available, introductory statistics textbook. The existing labs are in R.

This OpenIntro Statistics Python Labs project aims to convert those labs into the Python data analysis ecosystem: IPython, Pandas, statsmodels.
