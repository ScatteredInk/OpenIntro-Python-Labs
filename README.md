# OpenIntro Statistics Python Labs

[OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/) is an excellent, and freely available, introductory statistics textbook. The existing labs are in R.

This OpenIntro Statistics Python Labs project aims to convert those labs into the Python data analysis ecosystem: IPython, Pandas, statsmodels.

[Lab 0](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ScatteredInk/OpenIntro-Python-Labs/blob/master/Lab0/Lab-0-Instructions.ipynb): an Introduction to Pandas and IPython is complete.

Lab 1: Introduction in Data is in progress. The current repository notebook has the data ready but is instruction-free.

If you would like to contribute please do.
